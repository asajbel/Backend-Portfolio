            Currently living in Oakland, CA.
            <br>
            <br> I started programming in high school waking up early to go to zero period and learn C++. Eventually I went to UC: Santa Cruz and graduated from their Computer Science: Game Design program with the highest honors in the major.
            <br>
            <br> I spend my free time working with the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment to educate the public on video game history and development. I'm currently developing a graphical inventory system that also allows the public to view the items in the MADE's collection.
            <br>
            <br> Finding games an unfulfilling use of my skills I went to a full-stack coding bootcamp. I want to use programming and technology to solve the world's problems and provide a better tomorrow for the planet.
